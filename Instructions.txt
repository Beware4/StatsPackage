Instructions are simple:
  There is only one function that is programmed into this and it is the createstat(name, number, color) function
  What you do is this:
  
  You type createstat()
  Between the parenthesis, first type the name so if I used cow as a name it should look like this: createstat("cow")
  Next type the number that you want it to be on, this means that if there are 2 cows you will type: createstat("cow", 2)
  Next type the color of the stat bar: createstat("cow", 2, "green")
  This should make a bar labeled cow at the value of two that is the color green
  
  THERE IS NO PROPER DOCUMENTATION OF THIS SO IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND IT FULLY THEN JUST PLAY AROUND WITH IT UNTIL YOU GET IT!
